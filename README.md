## VBA Challenge - Stock Market Data Analysis
This project is a demonstration of using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate the analysis of stock market data, which includes quarterly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volume for multiple stock tickers across several quarters.

### Background
The goal of this project was to automate the process of calculating stock performance for each quarter.
To do this I used VBA to perform calculations on multiple sheets, reducing the need for manual data entry and repetitive tasks. I also implemented conditional formatting to visually highlight the results, to better understand what the data was telling me.

### Analysis
To begin the analysis, I needed to create VBA scripts to loop through all of the stock data for the quarters to help me calculate the following: the ticker symbol for each company, the quarterly change in the opening and closing stock prices, the percent change from the opening and closing prices, and the total stock volume of shares traded each quarter.

After I had this initial script, I then began to enhance the script by adding: the greatest % increase, the greatest % decrease, and the greatest total volume. Conditional formatting was then applied to better understand the changes in the stocks throughout the quarters.
